By simply rotating the monitor, you can hold the camera directly\n    overhead for above-the-crowd shots at concerts, or hold the camera at a\n    low angle for kids and pets. By rotating the LCD monitor fully, the EOS\n    Rebel T3i becomes the ideal camera for self-portraits. The EOS Rebel\n    T3i freely enables easy angle adjustments even if the camera is mounted\n    on a tripod or has a battery grip attach\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Automatic Scene Analysis for Standout Color <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i DSLR's new Scene Intelligent Auto mode unites\n    five Canon digital camera technologies - the new Picture Style Auto,\n    plus Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus,\n    and Automatic Exposure -into a powerful new feature for photographers.\n    Using the advanced EOS Scene Detection System, the camera automatically\n    analyzes the image, taking into account faces, colors, brightness,\n    movement and contrast. Scene Intelligent Auto then chooses the enhancing\n    features to deliver maximum impact. Blues and greens are more vivid,\n    \"hot\" colors are more fiery, and skin tones are smooth and truer to life\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Make Your Images As You See Them <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    Basic+ is a new creative imaging feature that makes it easy to\n    create the image effects you want. It can be set with the Quick Control\n    screen in Basic Zone modes. Basic+ provides two options:\n    <p>\n    <strong>Shoot by ambience selection<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p>\n    Based on the Picture Style and its parameters (sharpness, contrast,\n    saturation, and color tone), the exposure compensation and white balance\n    correction are adjusted to attain the selected ambience. You can also\n    can also select the strength of the ambience effect<\/p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>Shoot by lighting or scene type<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p>\n    Although the actual parameter set is the white balance, the settings are expressed in more understandable terms<\/p>\n    <p>\n    The Multi-Aspect Function of the EOS Rebel T3i lets you express an image\n    in one of three ways by matching the aspect ratio to each scene. In\n    addition to the camera's standard 3:2 ration, the Multi-Aspect Function\n    includes a 1:1 ratio that creates the sensation that the viewer's gaze\n    is focusing upon the center of the image. At the 4:3 ratio, you get\n    nearly the same aspect ratio as a regular TV or a 4:3 computer display.\n    The 16:9 aspect ratio provides a wide look, much the same as HDTV<\/p>\n    <p>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i incorporates five in-camera Creative Filters so you\n    can artistically manipulate scenes without the aid of an outside\n    computer. Soft Focus lends a dreamy, romantic aspect, while Grainy Black\n    and White gives a dramatically gritty, hard-bitten look. Miniature\n    Effect creates an illusion in which expansive subjects are seemingly\n    reduced to doll-house-like proportions, and Toy Camera Effect recreates\n    the colors and softness rendered by cameras with a plastic lens, an\n    effect often sought after by art photographers. Fish Eye Effect mimics\n    the \"Fisheye\" lenses that are favorites of professional photographers\n    for their quirky, convex perspective\n    <\/p>\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Intelligent Scene Analysis for Superb Exposure <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i features a sophisticated, 63 zone Dual-layer\n    sensor designed to complement the 9-point AF system. By taking into\n    account the color and luminosity surrounding chosen AF points, this\n    system delivers an advanced level of accuracy for better results even in\n    difficult lighting situations. Since the metering sensor has a color\n    measurement function, exposure errors and focus errors caused by\n    different light sources are minimized; the EOS Rebel T3i gives stable\n    exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes, such as in\n    a theater or concert hall. This makes the EOS Rebel T3i ideal for\n    scenes with extreme difference in brightness such as brightly lit scenes\n    or backlit scenes; the camera balances exposure of the main subject at\n    the background, and exposures are not overly influenced by bright areas\n    in the shot. Since the EOS Rebel T3i provides high-speed X-sync\n    (\"X-sync\" means the fastest shutter speed that can synchronize with a\n    flash burst at the moment the shutter is fully released) up to 1/200\n    sec., the range of photographic expression is dramatically increased,\n    allowing the EOS Rebel T3i to be used with confidence in bright scenes\n    or dim\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Never Miss a Moment <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i can shoot up to 3.7 frames per second (fps)\n    for up to approximately 6 consecutive RAW files or approximately 34\n    full-resolution JPEGs. Shooting at speeds of up to 1/4000 sec., the EOS\n    Rebel T3i can capture even rapidly-unfolding scenes with ease\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Photography Made Truly Easy <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The Canon EOS Rebel T3i DSLR demystifies great photography by\n    including an in-camera feature guide. Appearing on the camera's LCD, the\n    feature guide displays a simple description or advice for the\n    respective function. It is displayed in each shooting mode, during mode\n    dial operations, and for quick control screen functions (during normal\n    shooting, Live View shooting, movie shooting, and playback). The feature\n    guide appears automatically during mode dial operations and when a\n    function is selected on the quick control screen\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Flexible Storage with Memory Cards <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i uses popular SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards.\n    Compact, inexpensive and available in increasingly large capacities, SD,\n    SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS Rebel\n    T3i DSLR's compact and lightweight body design\n    <p>\n    Additionally, the EOS Rebel T3i is compatible with Eye-Fi SD cards,\n    which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and an\n    internal antenna for wireless, high-speed transfer of images. With an\n    Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel EOS Rebel T3i can display the\n    Eye-Fi's connection status and error notes with ease, for fully\n    functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera\n    <\/p>\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> EF Lenses <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF\n    lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from\n    ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced\n    optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver\n    outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special\n    technologies like the Canon Image Stabilizer technology in select lenses\n    helps to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to\n    four stops of light. With a dizzying array of lenses perfect for travel,\n    sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly\n    maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel T3i with\n    superlative Canon optics\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Flash Photography <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    With a flash sync speed of 1/200 of a second, the EOS Rebel T3i\n    also features the acclaimed E-TTL II flash metering system. With any of\n    the flashes in the EX Speedlite line, E-TTL II provides reliable flash\n    output whether shooting fill-in flash pictures in sunlight, or using\n    flash in total darkness. With E-TTL II, the exact same 35-zone metering\n    sensor used for measuring ambient light is also used for flash metering -\n    giving even finer metering command of the image area. If you prefer a\n    broader area for flash metering, there's a menu setting to change to\n    \"Average\" flash metering - where the entire 35-zone area is measured\n    evenly for flash exposure. Additionally, the EOS Rebel T3i has a\n    Speedlite transmitter built-in for convenient, full-featured wireless\n    control of EX-series Speedlite flashes set as slave units\n    <p>\n    The Canon Speedlite 430EX II is the ideal step-up accessory for powerful\n    flash shooting with the EOS Rebel T3i. It has excellent flash power\n    (maximum guide number of 141 ft./43m at ISO 100), and is the perfect way\n    to get great flash pictures when you can't get right up to the subject.\n    The 430EX II is also great for bounce flash, with its tilting and\n    swiveling flash head. It automatically zooms the flash head to cover\n    lenses ranging from 16mm up to 105mm or longer with the EOS Rebel T3i.\n    Of course, it works with the camera to provide full E-TTL II automatic\n    flash exposure. And the 430EX II has a powerful AF-assist beam, which\n    allows the camera to autofocus even in total darkness on subjects as far\n    as 32 ft. from the camera\n    <\/p>\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl> <\/div>\n        <div id=\"terms3\">\n        <h5>Item Specifications<\/h5>\n        <!-- TAB 3 TEXT GOES HERE --><ul><li>18.0 MP CMOS  sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor for high image quality and speed.<li>ISO 100 - 6400  for shooting from bright to dim light.<li>Improved EOS Full HD Movie mode with manual exposure control, expanded recording with new Movie Digital zoom<li>Vari-angle 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor (3:2) for shooting at high or low angles and 1,040,000-dot VGA with reflection reduction<li>New Scene Intelligent Auto mode and Picture Style Auto incorporating the new EOS Scene Detection System<li>Video Snapshot features for enhanced video shooting options.<\/ul> <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n        <div class=\"x-tb-btm x-ts-btm\"><!-- sp --><\/div>\n        <div class=\"x-tb-title x-ts-title-desc\" title=\"Item Details and Description for Exclusive Photo4Less Bundle\"><!-- sp --><\/div>\n        <div class=\"x-tb-top x-ts-top\"><!-- sp --><\/div>\n        <div id=\"x-tm-de02\" class=\"x-tb-mid x-ts-mid\">\n        <div class=\"x-tb-ins\"><!-- ADDITIONAL DESCR GOES HERE --><a name=\"CAT3I\"><\/a><table width=\"690\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td valign=\"middle\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 170px; vertical-align: middle;\">\n            <img alt=\"\" width=\"170\" src=\"http://cwa.photo4less.com/images/Products/CAT3I/747d4f2d-c630-4be7-928e-182afc09fd20.jpg\" id=\"desc_3pfk\" name=\"desc_3pfk\" />\n            <\/td>\n            <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" style=\"width: 520px; height: 150px;\">\n            <blockquote class=\"style6\"><br />\n            <h3>Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera Body<\/h3>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-top\"><\/div>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-mid\">\n            <div class=\"x-ki-content\">\n            <p>The <strong>Canon EOS Rebel T3i Digital Camera<\/strong> body puts the widely\nrespected value and flexibility of the Rebel DSLR at your fingertips.\nPair it with any Canon EF and EF-S lenses to create photographs that are\nuniquely your own.

Other recording sizes include HD at 1280 x 720 (50p/60p (59.94)\n    fps) or SD/VGA at 640 x 480 (30p (29.97) and 25p fps)\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Low Angles or High, a Big Vari-Angle LCD Captures All the Details <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i features a bright, high resolution, flip-out\n    Vari-angle 3.0\" Clear View LCD monitor for shooting at a variety of\n    angles. By simply rotating the monitor, you can hold the camera directly\n    overhead for above-the-crowd shots at concerts, or hold the camera at a\n    low angle for kids and pets. By rotating the LCD monitor fully, the EOS\n    Rebel T3i becomes the ideal camera for self-portraits. The EOS Rebel\n    T3i freely enables easy angle adjustments even if the camera is mounted\n    on a tripod or has a battery grip attach\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Automatic Scene Analysis for Standout Color <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i DSLR's new Scene Intelligent Auto mode unites\n    five Canon digital camera technologies - the new Picture Style Auto,\n    plus Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus,\n    and Automatic Exposure -into a powerful new feature for photographers.\n    Using the advanced EOS Scene Detection System, the camera automatically\n    analyzes the image, taking into account faces, colors, brightness,\n    movement and contrast. Scene Intelligent Auto then chooses the enhancing\n    features to deliver maximum impact. Blues and greens are more vivid,\n    \"hot\" colors are more fiery, and skin tones are smooth and truer to life\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Make Your Images As You See Them <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    Basic+ is a new creative imaging feature that makes it easy to\n    create the image effects you want. It can be set with the Quick Control\n    screen in Basic Zone modes. Basic+ provides two options:\n    <p>\n    <strong>Shoot by ambience selection<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p>\n    Based on the Picture Style and its parameters (sharpness, contrast,\n    saturation, and color tone), the exposure compensation and white balance\n    correction are adjusted to attain the selected ambience. You can also\n    can also select the strength of the ambience effect<\/p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>Shoot by lighting or scene type<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p>\n    Although the actual parameter set is the white balance, the settings are expressed in more understandable terms<\/p>\n    <p>\n    The Multi-Aspect Function of the EOS Rebel T3i lets you express an image\n    in one of three ways by matching the aspect ratio to each scene. In\n    addition to the camera's standard 3:2 ration, the Multi-Aspect Function\n    includes a 1:1 ratio that creates the sensation that the viewer's gaze\n    is focusing upon the center of the image. At the 4:3 ratio, you get\n    nearly the same aspect ratio as a regular TV or a 4:3 computer display.\n    The 16:9 aspect ratio provides a wide look, much the same as HDTV<\/p>\n    <p>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i incorporates five in-camera Creative Filters so you\n    can artistically manipulate scenes without the aid of an outside\n    computer. Soft Focus lends a dreamy, romantic aspect, while Grainy Black\n    and White gives a dramatically gritty, hard-bitten look. Miniature\n    Effect creates an illusion in which expansive subjects are seemingly\n    reduced to doll-house-like proportions, and Toy Camera Effect recreates\n    the colors and softness rendered by cameras with a plastic lens, an\n    effect often sought after by art photographers. Fish Eye Effect mimics\n    the \"Fisheye\" lenses that are favorites of professional photographers\n    for their quirky, convex perspective\n    <\/p>\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Intelligent Scene Analysis for Superb Exposure <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i features a sophisticated, 63 zone Dual-layer\n    sensor designed to complement the 9-point AF system. By taking into\n    account the color and luminosity surrounding chosen AF points, this\n    system delivers an advanced level of accuracy for better results even in\n    difficult lighting situations. Since the metering sensor has a color\n    measurement function, exposure errors and focus errors caused by\n    different light sources are minimized; the EOS Rebel T3i gives stable\n    exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes, such as in\n    a theater or concert hall. This makes the EOS Rebel T3i ideal for\n    scenes with extreme difference in brightness such as brightly lit scenes\n    or backlit scenes; the camera balances exposure of the main subject at\n    the background, and exposures are not overly influenced by bright areas\n    in the shot. Since the EOS Rebel T3i provides high-speed X-sync\n    (\"X-sync\" means the fastest shutter speed that can synchronize with a\n    flash burst at the moment the shutter is fully released) up to 1/200\n    sec., the range of photographic expression is dramatically increased,\n    allowing the EOS Rebel T3i to be used with confidence in bright scenes\n    or dim\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Never Miss a Moment <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i can shoot up to 3.7 frames per second (fps)\n    for up to approximately 6 consecutive RAW files or approximately 34\n    full-resolution JPEGs. Shooting at speeds of up to 1/4000 sec., the EOS\n    Rebel T3i can capture even rapidly-unfolding scenes with ease\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Photography Made Truly Easy <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The Canon EOS Rebel T3i DSLR demystifies great photography by\n    including an in-camera feature guide. Appearing on the camera's LCD, the\n    feature guide displays a simple description or advice for the\n    respective function. It is displayed in each shooting mode, during mode\n    dial operations, and for quick control screen functions (during normal\n    shooting, Live View shooting, movie shooting, and playback). The feature\n    guide appears automatically during mode dial operations and when a\n    function is selected on the quick control screen\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Flexible Storage with Memory Cards <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i uses popular SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards.\n    Compact, inexpensive and available in increasingly large capacities, SD,\n    SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS Rebel\n    T3i DSLR's compact and lightweight body design\n    <p>\n    Additionally, the EOS Rebel T3i is compatible with Eye-Fi SD cards,\n    which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and an\n    internal antenna for wireless, high-speed transfer of images. With an\n    Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel EOS Rebel T3i can display the\n    Eye-Fi's connection status and error notes with ease, for fully\n    functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera\n    <\/p>\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> EF Lenses <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    The EOS Rebel T3i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF\n    lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from\n    ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced\n    optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver\n    outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special\n    technologies like the Canon Image Stabilizer technology in select lenses\n    helps to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to\n    four stops of light. With a dizzying array of lenses perfect for travel,\n    sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly\n    maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel T3i with\n    superlative Canon optics\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n    <dt> Flash Photography <\/dt>\n    <dd>\n    With a flash sync speed of 1/200 of a second, the EOS Rebel T3i\n    also features the acclaimed E-TTL II flash metering system. With any of\n    the flashes in the EX Speedlite line, E-TTL II provides reliable flash\n    output whether shooting fill-in flash pictures in sunlight, or using\n    flash in total darkness. With E-TTL II, the exact same 35-zone metering\n    sensor used for measuring ambient light is also used for flash metering -\n    giving even finer metering command of the image area. If you prefer a\n    broader area for flash metering, there's a menu setting to change to\n    \"Average\" flash metering - where the entire 35-zone area is measured\n    evenly for flash exposure. Additionally, the EOS Rebel T3i has a\n    Speedlite transmitter built-in for convenient, full-featured wireless\n    control of EX-series Speedlite flashes set as slave units\n    <p>\n    The Canon Speedlite 430EX II is the ideal step-up accessory for powerful\n    flash shooting with the EOS Rebel T3i. It has excellent flash power\n    (maximum guide number of 141 ft./43m at ISO 100), and is the perfect way\n    to get great flash pictures when you can't get right up to the subject.\n    The 430EX II is also great for bounce flash, with its tilting and\n    swiveling flash head. It automatically zooms the flash head to cover\n    lenses ranging from 16mm up to 105mm or longer with the EOS Rebel T3i.\n    Of course, it works with the camera to provide full E-TTL II automatic\n    flash exposure. And the 430EX II has a powerful AF-assist beam, which\n    allows the camera to autofocus even in total darkness on subjects as far\n    as 32 ft. from the camera\n    <\/p>\n    <\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n            <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-btm\"><\/div>\n            <\/blockquote>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" style=\"height: 1px;\">\n            <div class=\"style7\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"#main\"><\/a><\/div>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td colspan=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"x-ki-sep\"><\/div>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n    <\/tbody>\n<\/table><a name=\"GRADTB\"><\/a><table width=\"690\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td valign=\"middle\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 170px; vertical-align: middle;\">\n            <img alt=\"\" width=\"170\" src=\"http://cwa.photo4less.com/images/Products/GRADTB/b2116a05-a508-4a78-a909-a7fc64d4fbce.jpg\" id=\"desc_3pfk\" name=\"desc_3pfk\" />\n            <\/td>\n            <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" style=\"width: 520px; height: 150px;\">\n            <blockquote class=\"style6\"><br />\n            <h3>Graduation Teddy Bear<\/h3>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-top\"><\/div>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-mid\">\n            <div class=\"x-ki-content\">\n            An adorable graduation teddy bear to celebrate your graduation.\n            <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-btm\"><\/div>\n            <\/blockquote>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" style=\"height: 1px;\">\n            <div class=\"style7\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"#main\"><\/a><\/div>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td colspan=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"x-ki-sep\"><\/div>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n    <\/tbody>\n<\/table><a name=\"CA1855ISWB\"><\/a><table width=\"690\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td valign=\"middle\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 170px; vertical-align: middle;\">\n            <img alt=\"\" width=\"170\" src=\"http://cwa.photo4less.com/images/Products/CA1855ISWB/afa915c5-6eab-4c5d-b242-ed31f9709ef6.jpg\" id=\"desc_3pfk\" name=\"desc_3pfk\" />\n            <\/td>\n            <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" style=\"width: 520px; height: 150px;\">\n            <blockquote class=\"style6\"><br />\n            <h3>Canon Zoom Wide Angle-Normal EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Autofocus Lens<\/h3>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-top\"><\/div>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-mid\">\n            <div class=\"x-ki-content\">\n            <p>The Canon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 EF-S IS Lens is a standard zoom lens that features the smaller size image circle, exclusively designed for EOS Digital Rebel and other cameras using the APS-C size sensor.

Lens filters improve\nphotographs by giving photographers\ncontrol over light and allowing\nthem to emphasize the features\nof a scene that they consider\nmost important. This particular\nfilter kit is a combination of\nthe three essential filters\nno photographer should be without.<\/p>\n<p>Filters\nare one of the least expensive\naccessories you can use to make\nbig changes in the way your pictures\nlook.                <\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>UV Filters<br />\n    A UV filter is used to reduce UV rays from entering the lens and\n    striking the film. Modern lenses often have UV protection built into\n    them as well as digital sensors, however, UV filters are commonly used\n    to help protect the surface of the lens from scratches, smudges, dirt\n    and other hazards. <br />\n    <br />\n    <\/li>\n    <li>Circular Polarizing Filters <br />\n    No camera bag should be without a polarizing filter, whether you shoot\n    digital, color film, color slide, or black and white. A polarizer is\n    different than most filters in that it is composed of two pieces of\n    glass, mounted independently inside a round frame so that one can be\n    rotated relative to the other. As it is rotated, it increasingly cuts\n    out glare and haze. With an SLR, you can actually observe this change\n    through the viewfinder. Polarizers reduce glare from water, glass, or\n    any non-metallic surface. You can also use a polarizer filter to darken\n    blue skies.<br />\n    <br />\n    <\/li>\n    <li>FLD Filters<br />\n    A FLD filter (fluorescent light correction) provides the perfect\n    solution for\n    obtaining pleasing skin tones and correct color\n    while shooting without a flash\n    under fluorescent lighting.

Lens filters improve\nphotographs by giving photographers\ncontrol over light and allowing\nthem to emphasize the features\nof a scene that they consider\nmost important. This particular\nfilter kit is a combination of\nthe three essential filters\nno photographer should be without.<\/p>\n<p>Filters\nare one of the least expensive\naccessories you can use to make\nbig changes in the way your pictures\nlook.                <\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>UV Filters<br />\n    A UV filter is used to reduce UV rays from entering the lens and\n    striking the film. Modern lenses often have UV protection built into\n    them as well as digital sensors, however, UV filters are commonly\n    used\n    to help protect the surface of the lens from scratches, smudges,\n    dirt\n    and other hazards. <br />\n    <br />\n    <\/li>\n    <li>Polarizing Filters <br />\n    No camera bag should be without a polarizing filter, whether you\n    shoot\n    digital, color film, color slide, or black and white. A polarizer is\n    different than most filters in that it is composed of two pieces of\n    glass, mounted independently inside a round frame so that one can be\n    rotated relative to the other. As it is rotated, it increasingly\n    cuts\n    out glare and haze. With an SLR, you can actually observe this\n    change\n    through the viewfinder. Polarizers reduce glare from water, glass,\n    or\n    any non-metallic surface. You can also use a polarizer filter to\n    darken\n    blue skies.<br />\n    <br />\n    <\/li>\n    <li>FLD Filters<br />\n    A FLD filter (fluorescent light correction) provides the perfect\n    solution for\n    obtaining pleasing skin tones and correct color\n    while shooting without a flash\n    under fluorescent lighting. This filter gives\n    true-to-life color rendition by\n    removing the harsh yellow-green cast ordinarily\n    resulting from fluorescent\n    bulbs. When shooting under natural light, a\n    fluorescent filter dramatically\n    increases color saturation of subjects such as\n    sunrises and sunsets.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n            <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-btm\"><\/div>\n            <\/blockquote>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" style=\"height: 1px;\">\n            <div class=\"style7\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"#main\"><\/a><\/div>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td colspan=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"x-ki-sep\"><\/div>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n    <\/tbody>\n<\/table><a name=\"GBSDCR\"><\/a><table width=\"690\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td valign=\"middle\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 170px; vertical-align: middle;\">\n            <img alt=\"\" width=\"170\" src=\"http://cwa.photo4less.com/images/Products/GBSDCR/188138d8-240e-43ec-873c-297090d54106.jpg\" id=\"desc_3pfk\" name=\"desc_3pfk\" />\n            <\/td>\n            <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" style=\"width: 520px; height: 150px;\">\n            <blockquote class=\"style6\"><br />\n            <h3>Hi-Speed SD USB Card Reader<\/h3>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-top\"><\/div>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-mid\">\n            <div class=\"x-ki-content\">\n            <p><span>A card reader\nis a small piece of hardware with simple Plug &amp; Play features that\nconnects directly to your PC via a USB port and allows you to transfer\npictures &amp; other media files without the need to plug your camera to\nthe PC.<\/span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<\/p>\n<br />\n            <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-btm\"><\/div>\n            <\/blockquote>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" style=\"height: 1px;\">\n            <div class=\"style7\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"#main\"><\/a><\/div>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td colspan=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"x-ki-sep\"><\/div>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n    <\/tbody>\n<\/table><a name=\"GBLCK3\"><\/a><table width=\"690\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td valign=\"middle\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 170px; vertical-align: middle;\">\n            <img alt=\"\" width=\"170\" src=\"http://cwa.photo4less.com/images/Products/GBLCK3/6b1273e0-57ac-453b-b659-91ff1d13fcc6.jpg\" id=\"desc_3pfk\" name=\"desc_3pfk\" />\n            <\/td>\n            <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" style=\"width: 520px; height: 150px;\">\n            <blockquote class=\"style6\"><br />\n            <h3>Camera & Lens 3 Piece Cleaning Kit<\/h3>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-top\"><\/div>\n            <div class=\"x-ki-inset-mid\">\n            <div class=\"x-ki-content\">\n            This 3 piece Camera Lens cleaning kit is perfect to carry in your camera bag.
